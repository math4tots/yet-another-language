A little script for generate headers for gl-matrix

glmatrix.json was created by running `npx jsdoc -X` on `gl-matrix-3.4.1/src`

I was hoping to autogenerate the interfaces, but I see that the information here isn't perfect.

It's the same one used in `https://glmatrix.net/docs` - e.g. i see return type for toRadian missing
